Working with Exercises

Author Notes:

This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage. This is a handy way to Or you can simply add /tree/BRANCH_NAME to the URL to go to the branch you want to peek at.

Most of the time, we'll be making changes to the files in the src directory.

Branches
The branches are structured so that they correspond to the videos in the course. So, for example if I name a branch 02_03 then that branch corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. The extra letter at the end of the name corresponds to the state of the branch. A b means that this is how the code looks at the beginning of the video, an e means that is how the code looked at the end of the video. The master branch usually has the final state of the code when I finish the course.
