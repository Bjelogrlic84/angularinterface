# Angular

Building an Interface

> > Author Notes:

The web started out as a series of connected pages, but at some point it grew to allow interfaces to help people get stuff done. Hey there, I'm Ray Villalobos and in this course, I'm going to show you how to build an interface with Angular.

This course shows you how to solve a common problem, managing appointments for a company...in our case making appointments for a Pet Doctor. In order to take care of that, we'll create a form that lets people add appointments, read a list of the appointments from a file and also delete, modify, search and sort those appointments.

This course is meant to be a practical hands-on guide that shows you how Angular works using plain language. It's different than other courses because building something realistic shows you how things are connected and how to solve real problems with the language. I hope you take the time to work through the problems with me as I go through the course.

This course is also part of a series of courses where I've built a similar application in different languages like jQuery, React and Vue.js...That means that going through these course can help you analyze the advantages that one framework has over the others.

So if that sounds like something you'd want to try out, then it's time to get started.
