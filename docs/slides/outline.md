# Angular

Building an Interface

> > Author Notes:

The web started out as a series of connected pages, but at some point it grew to allow interfaces to help people get stuff done. Hey there, I'm Ray Villalobos and in this course, I'm going to show you how to build an interface with Angular.

This course shows you how to solve a common problem, managing appointments for a company...in our case making appointments for a Pet Doctor. In order to take care of that, we'll create a form that lets people add appointments, read a list of the appointments from a file and also delete, modify, search and sort those appointments.

This course is meant to be a practical hands-on guide that shows you how Angular works using plain language. It's different than other courses because building something realistic shows you how things are connected and how to solve real problems with the language. I hope you take the time to work through the problems with me as I go through the course.

This course is also part of a series of courses where I've built a similar application in different languages like jQuery, React and Vue.js...That means that going through these course can help you analyze the advantages that one framework has over the others.

So if that sounds like something you'd want to try out, then it's time to get started.

- [Narrator] Before we get started, let's take a quick look at what Angular is so that you'll get an idea of what you'll be learning in this course. Angular is an application framework, which means a way of structuring your code that makes it easier to build applications using web technologies. There are two versions of the Angular framework: Angular One, also known as Angular JS, and this version of Angular, which means anything after Angular One. Now that means anything greater than Angular Two, and currently Angular is on version five.
  Now, Angular itself, not Angular JS, is a component-based framework, which means that the way you build code is by creating small pieces of code and then connecting them together. Each piece can contain its own scripts, templates and CSS, and can talk to other components. Now, the Angular framework itself is considered to be a modular framework, and that means that you don't just build small components yourself, but that in order to use different features of the framework you load up only the pieces that you need.
  And that makes this framework super fast and efficient. One of the key features of the framework is something called data binding. This involves learning how to connect your templates, which are sometimes called views, and your information, which is sometimes called models or data. Angular has a rich templating system that looks like HTML with some additional formats for attributes and even tags that you build and define yourself. It's pretty easy to pick up and work with. Making the connections between components can be a bit challenging, so Angular provides a CLI or command line interface.
  This is a little application that you install and load with your terminal that makes it easier to create the connections between components. In the rest of this chapter, we're going to take a look at how the CLI works. So if you're ready to get started, let's take a look at installing the CLI in the next video.
